# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has 10 attempts to guess the correct number. If they guess the correct number within 10 attempts, they win. If they run out of attempts, they lose.

2. Click the "Submit Guess" button to submit your guess.
3. The game will tell you if your guess is correct or not.

5. After each guess, you'll see the remaining guesses and the numbers you've previously guessed.
6. If you win, the game will notify you of the number of attempts it took.
